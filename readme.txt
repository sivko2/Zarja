PROJECT ZARJA: Single-hand App Launcher
for Google Experiments
License: GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0)

Launch apps on your Android phone with a single hand.

The app helps you use your phone when you have only one free hand (e.g. while driving, pushing a shopping cart or a stroller, holding bags or coats).

1. Tap and hold on the radar icon with your thumb (left or right bottom corner). Icons will start moving toward your finger.
2. When the app you want to launch is near your thumb, drag it onto that icon.
3. Lift your thumb to launch the app.

The more often you launch an app, the closer to your thumb it will be next time you use the launcher.

Use settings to switch between right and left-hand usage or to set the speed of icon movement.
